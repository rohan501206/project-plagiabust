1) Name three agile software development methods/approaches and give a brief description of each method. 
 
a) Extreme Programming (XP) 
The name comes in because this method takes an ‘extreme’ approach to iterative development. Here, all 
requirements are expressed as scenarios, which are directly implemented as a series of tasks. A pair of 
programmers work together in this, and before writing the code, they develop tests for each task. All 
tests must be successfully completed before new code is integrated into the system. 
Customers are treated as part of the development team, and are welcomed to intimately discuss about 
scenarios with other team members rather than just listing a set of requirements. [1] 
 
b) Scrum 
This method introduces the idea of ‘empirical process control’, which is the use of the real-world 
progress of a project to plan and schedule releases. Projects are divided into distinct phases, called 
‘sprints’, which are one to three weeks in duration. At the end of each sprint, development team and 
stakeholders gather to assess the progress. Here, the next steps of the project are decided based on the 
complete work, rather than relying on predictions or speculations. [2] 
Three main roles are defined in this method, which are namely Scrum Master, Product Owner and Team 
Member. The Scrum Master maintains the processes, and has similarities with project managers. Product 
Owner represents stakeholders and the business, while Team Members do the actual analysis, design, 
implementation, testing, etc. [3] 
 
c) Feature Driven Development (FDD) 
Originally found by the global IT strategist and technical writer Jeff De Luca, this method is a model-
driven, short-iteration process that consists of five main activities.  
Of these activities, the first step is developing an Overall Model, the result being a high-level object 
model and notes. Secondly, a Features List is built, in which the items gathered during the initial 
modeling are grouped into related sets and subject areas. Next, Plan By Feature happens, where the 
development plan is produced. Class and Feature Set owners are also identified. 
The next two steps, which comprise roughly 75% of the of the overall project, are named Design By 
Feature and Build By Feature. From the production of design packages for each feature to finally 
promoting tested and completed features to the main build take place within these two steps. [4] 
 
 
2) Name the four values in the Agile Manifesto. 
 
a) Individuals and interactions over processes and tools 
b) Working software over comprehensive documentation 
c) Customer collaboration over contract negotiation 
d) Responding to change over following a plan 
3) Select two from the above values, and briefly describe how each of the three agile methods named in 
question (1) satisfies the chosen Agile Manifesto values. 
 
 Responding to change over following a 
plan 
Customer collaboration over contract 
negotiation 
Extreme Programming Rather than following a pre-set plan, 
change is responded with regular 
system releases, test-first development 
and continuous integration. Releases of 
the system are frequent and 
functionalities are added incrementally. 
These functionalities are tested before 
implementation. So any changes in 
specification or other requirements can 
be responded without fuss. [1] 
Customers are engaged in the 
development process on a full-time 
basis. In a XP process, the customer is a 
member of the development team, and 
is responsible for defining acceptance 
tests and bringing system requirements 
for implementation. This is a huge 
amount of customer involvement when 
compared with negotiating a contract. 
[1] 
Scrum At the completion of each Sprint, the 
team and stakeholders gather to assess 
the project progress, and to plan the 
next steps. The next Sprint starts based 
on this discussion. So the project’s 
direction is adjusted or re-oriented 
purely based on completed work and 
current environmental changes, rather 
than an initially set up plan. [2] 
Customers are very much involved in the 
project throughout the duration. 
Continuous discussions are held at the 
end of each Sprint, in which customers 
have a major say. Also, the role of 
Product Owner keeps the development 
team and stakeholders in touch during 
the process, which additionally strikes 
the right balance in the customer 
involvement. [2] 
Feature Driven 
Development 
The iterative nature of FDD ensures that 
adaptability is a key ingredient. If an 
area of risk is identified during the 
modeling phase, where requirements 
may change, or are not yet fixed 
permanently, the particular area in 
concern could be decoupled and 
isolated to ensure the impact of change 
is minimized. [5] 
Direct collaboration is highly encouraged 
in this method. During the code reviews 
of the construction phase, discussion 
meetings make way for open 
communication. Also, the Knowledge 
Management System, a repository 
which is put in place to capture and 
publish all essential communication 
regarding the project, helps to engage 
and involve the customer in an active 
manner. [5]
