• Scrum:- 
This is an empirical approach that has been developed for managing the systems 
development process applying the ideas of industrial process control theory to systems 
development resulting in an approach that introduces the ideas of flexibility, adaptability 
and productivity. This does not define any specific software development techniques for the 
implementation phase and it concentrates only on how the team members should function 
in order to produce the system flexibility in a constantly changing environment. The main 
idea of scrum is that systems development involves several environmental and technical 
variables (e.g. requirements, time frame, resources and technology) that are likely to change 
during the process. This makes the development process unpredictable and complex, 
requiring flexibility of the systems development process for it to be able to respond to the 
changes.  
• Crystal family:- 
Crystal family of methodologies includes a number of different methodologies for selecting 
the most suitable methodology for each individual project and the crystal approach includes 
principles for tailoring the methodologies to fit the varying circumstances of different 
projects. Each member of the crystal family is marked with a colour indicating the 
‘heaviness’ of the methodology (i.e. the darker the colour the heavier the methodology), 
and crystal suggests choosing the appropriate colour of methodology for a project based on 
its size and criticality. Larger projects are likely to ask for more coordination and heavier 
methodologies than smaller ones. 
• Feature driven development:- 
FDD is an agile and adaptive approach for developing systems that does not cover entire 
software development process, but rather focuses on the design and building phases. It has 
been designed to work with the other activities of a software development project and does 
not require any specific process model to be used. FDD embodies iterative development and 
the best practices found to be effective in industry. It emphases quality aspects throughout 
the process and includes frequent and tangible deliveries, along with accurate monitoring of 
the progress of the project. FDD also include roles, artefacts, goals, and timelines needed in 
a project. FDD claim to suitable for the development of critical systems.

• Individuals and interactions over processes and tools 
• Working software over comprehensive documentation 
• Customer collaboration over contract negotiation 
• Responding to change over following a plan

 Customer collaboration Responding to change 
Scrum At the end of each sprint, stakeholders 
and team members meet to assess the 
progress of a project and plan its next 
steps. This allows a project’s direction 
to be adjusted or reoriented based on 
completed work, not speculation or 
predictions.  
Accepts that the requirement cannot be fully 
understood and defined and accepts 
emerging requirements. Each changed 
requirement can be taken into care during 
meetings held at the end of each sprint. 
Crystal The sponsors get critical feedback on 
the rate of progress of the team. Users 
get a chance to discover whether their 
original request was for what they 
actually need and to get their 
discoveries fed back into development. 
 
Here the development is done in iterations 
and results are released to users at the end 
of each iteration. Then they can suggest any 
change in requirement they need. But during 
an iteration requirements cannot be 
changed. 
FDD In FDD a special role called ‘Domain 
Expert’ has been established and they 
are responsible for keeping in touch 
with stakeholders and passing the 
knowledge to developers in order to 
ensure that the developer delivers a 
competent system. 
Process is carried out in smaller granular 
mode (i.e. iterations are small) so the 
changes can be responded as soon as 
possible.
