1) 1. Extreme Programming 
  This is the best known and most widely used agile development method. Extreme 
Programming is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing 
customer requirements. Other elements of extreme programming include: programming in pairs or 
doing extensive code review, unit testing of all code, avoiding programming of features until they 
are actually needed, a flat management structure, simplicity and clarity in code, expecting changes 
in the customer's requirements as time passes and the problem is better understood, and frequent 
communication with the customer and among programmers.

2. Dynamic Systems Development Method  
  Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) is a software development 
methodology originally based upon the Rapid Application Development methodology. DSDM is 
an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes continuous user involvement. Its goal is to 
deliver software systems on time and on budget while adjusting for changing requirements along 
the development process.

3. Feature Driven Development  
  Feature Driven Development (FDD) is an iterative and incremental software 
development process. It is one of a number of agile methods for developing software and forms part 
of the Agile Alliance. FDD blends a number of industry-recognized best practices into a cohesive 
whole. These practices are all driven from a client-valued functionality perspective. Its main purpose 
is to deliver tangible, working software repeatedly in a timely manner.

2) • Individuals and interactions over processes and tools 
• Working software over comprehensive documentation 
• Customer collaboration over contract negotiation 
• Responding to change over following a plan

 Working software Customer collaboration 
Extreme Programming Extreme Programming 
encourages starting with the 
simplest solution. Extra 
functionality can then be added 
later. The difference between 
this approach and more 
conventional system 
development methods is the 
focus on designing and coding 
for the needs of today instead of 
those of tomorrow, next week, 
or next month.[1] 
In Extreme Programming 
Programmers must listen to 
what the customers need the 
system to do, what "business 
logic" is needed. They must 
understand these needs well 
enough to give the customer 
feedback about the technical 
aspects of how the problem 
might be solved, or cannot be 
solved. [1] 
Feature Driven Development  
 
Any function that is too complex 
to be implemented within two 
weeks is further decomposed 
into smaller functions until each 
sub-problem is small enough to 
be called a feature. This makes 
it easier to deliver correct 
functions and to extend or 
modify the system.[2] 
In Feature Driven Development  
Regular builds ensure there is 
always an up to date system 
that can be demonstrated to the 
client and helps highlighting 
integration errors of source 
code for the features early.[2] 
Dynamic Systems 
Development Method  
This method  focus on frequent 
delivery of products, with 
assumption that to deliver 
something "good enough" 
earlier is always better than to 
deliver everything "perfectly" in 
the end. By delivering product 
frequently from an early stage 
of the project, the product can 
be tested and reviewed where 
the test record and review 
document can be taken into 
account at the next iteration or 
phase.[3] 
In the DSDM Project lifecycle 
the Business Stage is the Stage 
where the essential 
characteristics of business and 
technology are analysed. 
Approach to organise 
workshops, where a sufficient 
number of the customer’s 
experts are gathered to be able 
to consider all relevant facets 
of the system, and to be able to 
agree on development 
priorities. [3]
